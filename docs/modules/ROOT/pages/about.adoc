= About model2owl

The *model2owl* https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl/[GitHub project] comprises a set of tools for transforming a UML (v2.5) model from its XMI (v2.5.1) serialisation into a formal ontology. This transformation is performed using XSLT stylesheets under the assumption that the UML model conforms to the set of conventions outlined in this documentation.

This work is developed in the context of the https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology[eProcurement ontology] project. However, the tools can be used on any other ontology that is built following the xref:architecture/ontology-architecture.adoc[architectural design] and xref:uml/conceptual-model-conventions.adoc[conceptual model conventions] described in this documentation. *[TODO: check this paragraph for sanity]*
