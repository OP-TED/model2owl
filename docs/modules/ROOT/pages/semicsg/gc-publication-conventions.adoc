== 5-star Linked Open Data

|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* 5-star Linked Open Data

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* PC-R1

|*Statement:*

Publishing the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles shall be compliant with 5-star LOD criteria.
|===

*Description:*

Publishing a vocabulary as a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource means making it accessible, both human and machine-readable, in a
standard way, thus supporting the semantic web. The publication as full LOD implies that the data is compliant with the
highest grade of 5-Star [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:5star-od[5star-od]] open data evaluation:

* The data is available on the Web under an open licence
* The data is available following a clear structure
* The data is available using a non-proprietary open format
* The data uses URIs to denote concepts
* The data is linked to other resources to provide context

== Persistent URI policy

|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Persistent URI policy

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* PC-R2

|*Statement:*

The URIs that are used to identify the terms modelled in the data specifications should be _dereferenceable Persistent URIs_
[xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:10rules-puri[10rules-puri]] and comply with a URI policy (or URI strategy).

URIs that are well-defined according to such criteria are often denoted as PURIs [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:10rules-puri[10rules-puri]].

SEMIC adheres to the EU persistent URI policy. Each SEMIC URI is dereferenceable in both machine representation (RDF
artefacts) and human-readable (HTML artefact).
|===

*Description:*

When publishing  data on the web [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:dwdp[dwdp]], it is crucial to have a structured and persistent system
of URIs in place. Such URIs make it easy for the users to understand the vocabulary structure and retrieve information as they expect.

The 10 rules for Persistent URIs [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:10rules-puri[10rules-puri]] are base principles for the design of quality identifiers.
Regarding URI design, the main consideration of creators should be that when a URI is created, all its parts should be
resistant to change. For instance, locations and organisation names can change and therefore should not be used in URIs.
First and foremost, when introducing semantics in URIs, the strings used need to reflect what the resources are (i.e. intrinsic
characteristics such as the type or nature), not who owns them or where they are [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:uri-dp[uri-dp]].

In 2014, the ISA Programme devised a common policy for managing persistent HTTP-based URIs of EU institutions [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:uri-dp[uri-dp],
xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:10rules-puri[10rules-puri], xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:puri-gov-eu[puri-gov-eu]]. That has led to an EU wide URI resolution service, prescribing
that each URI is of the following pattern:

`http://data.europa.eu/\{Collection\}/\{Reference\}`

The `\{Collection\}` is an organisation-agnostic name for a collection of terms. Within a `\{Collection\}` the local names, or
references, are being maintained according to the policy of the `\{Collection\}`. For SEMIC data specifications, the names
are dependent on the naming conventions mentioned in this style guide rules [xref:semicsg/gc-general-conventions.adoc#sec:gc-r4[GC-R4] + xref:semicsg/gc-conceptual-model-conventions.adoc#sec:cmc-r3[CMC-R3]].

xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:dwbp[dwbp],
]

****
*Examples:*

For example, the PURIs defined within the SEMIC Core Vocabularies are all within the `\{Collection\}` m8g. And thus  the term
Evidence in the context of CCCEV is denoted with the PURI `http://data.europa.eu/m8g/Evidence`.

== Version management

|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Version management

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* PC-R3

|*Statement:*

A consistent version management shall be implemented for the vocabulary evolution respecting the "semantic versioning"
principles. [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:sem-ver[sem-ver]]
|===

*Description:*

The SEMIC versioning methodology is based on "semantic versioning" principles and implements a simple set of rules and
requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. It involves describing clearly and precisely
what is being published and which features are included, and what the limitations are, setting the expectations and scope.
Once the artefacts are identified for the public, the changes to the data specifications are communicated  with specific
increments to  the version number and with associated change notes.

The version format is __ X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch)__.

As a rule of thumb, bug fixes do not affect the artefact and increment the Patch version. Backwards compatible artefact
additions/changes increment the Minor version. And, backwards-incompatible artefact changes increment the Major version.

****
*Examples:*

For example, evolving from version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6 represents a backwards-compatible patch, from 1.3.5 to 1.4.0, a
backwards-compatible new development, while switching from 1.3.5 to 2.0.0 breaks the backwards compatibility.

== Artefact versioning

|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Artefact versioning

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* PC-R4

|*Statement:*

The vocabularies and Application Profiles shall be versioned as a whole and never to atomic elements (concepts, relations
or constraints).
|===

*Description:*

Create a new version with each publication. Using the semantic version principles to determine the exact version number
depends on whether it is a major, minor or patch update.

The version shall be assigned to the entire vocabulary or Application Profile and never to elements in the model
(concepts, relations, constraints, etc.) [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:oslo-rules[oslo-rules, sec 3.1.6]]. The version shall be saved as the model metadata
(for example, in the `owl:Ontology` header).

No version information shall be embedded into any artefact URIs unless it is a version URI provided via `owl:versionIRI`.

== URI dereferencing

|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* URI dereferencing

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* PC-R5

|*Statement:*

Any URI identifiable resource devised in a data specification shall be dereferenceable.
|===

*Description:*

Dereferencing means that one can use the URI as an URL to retrieve related information back. The format and representation
in which the information is returned depend on content negotiation. Content negotiation is the interaction between the client
application and the server in which the client informs the server about its preferred format and representation and the server
responds with the best-fitting result it can provide.

It is recommended to provide (format) content negotiation for HTTP which is based on the interpretation of the HTTP header Accept.

The dereferencing shall be provided for both human-readable and machine-readable formats. A human-aimed HTML representation is the
default response (if no content type is specified), and the other is RDF [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:10rules-puri[10rules-puri]].

The HTML representation should have landing points based on the used fragment identifier. The other representations/formats.
Further technical details can be found in "Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies" [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:rdf-pub[rdf-pub]].

== Human-readable form

|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Human-readable form

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* PC-R6

|*Statement:*

Each artefact shall have a corresponding human-readable form representing the model documentation.
|===

*Description:*

The documentation content shall follow a standard template for consistent formatting and content structuring.

It is a good practice to provide the following sections in the document:

* Preamble with metadata indicating
** Title
** Abstract
** Date of publication/release
** Version information
** Authors, editors, contributors
** Licensing information
* Introduction describing the
** Background information
** Context & Scope
** Intended audience
** UML diagrams of the model
* Description of each element in the model grouped by element type (e.g. class, property, constraint, controlled vocabulary). Each element shall be described by its URI and its Lexicalisation:
** URI (shall be clearly visible)
** Labels (preferred and alternative)
** Definitions, scope notes, examples, editorial notes, etc.

The content of these fields shall be aligned as much as possible with the metadata published in the OWL 2 representation (see [xref:semicsg/gc-semantic-conventions.adoc#sec:sc-r2[SC-R2]]).
