== Common terms and acronyms

* XMI [http://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/]
** The XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is an Object Management Group (OMG) standard for exchanging metadata information via Extensible Markup Language (XML). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange]
* UML [http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/]
** The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language]
* OWL 2 [https://www.w3.org/OWL/]
** The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) is a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. [https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/]
* RDF [https://www.w3.org/RDF/]
** Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard originally designed as a data model for metadata. It has come to be used as a general method for description and exchange of graph data. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework]
* RDFS [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/]
** RDF Schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data. RDF Schema is an extension of the basic RDF vocabulary. [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/]
* XML [https://www.w3.org/XML/]
** Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML]
* ASCII [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII]
** ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII]
* SHACL [https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/]
** SHACL Shapes Constraint Language is defined as a language for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions. These conditions are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph.  [https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/]
* DL [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic]
** Description logics (DL) are a family of formal knowledge representation languages. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic]
* UML Element [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(UML)]
** In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an Element is an abstract class with no superclass. It is used as the superclass or base class, as known by object oriented programmers, for all the metaclasses in the UML infrastructure library. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(UML)]
* UML Element Name [https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/]
** A NamedElement is an Element in a model that may have a name. The name may be given directly and/or via the use of a StringExpression. [https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1/PDF]
* UML Element Tag [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_(UML)]
** Tag is an extension of the properties of a UML element that allows you to add new information to an element's specification. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_(UML)]
* UML Attribute [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_terms]
** Attribute is a significant piece of data owned by a Class, often containing values describing each instance of the class. Besides the attribute name and a slot for the attribute value, an attribute may have specified Visibility, Type, Multiplicity, Default value, and Property-string. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_terms]
* UML Connector [https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/]
** A Connector specifies links that enables communication between two or more instances. In contrast to Associations, which specify links between any instance of the associated Classifiers, Connectors specify links between instances playing the connected parts only. [https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1/PDF]
