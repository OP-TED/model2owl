The https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl/[*model2owl*] project comprises a set of tools for transforming an UML (v2.5) model from its XMI (v2.5.1) serialisation into a formal OWL ontology, and a SHACL shape. This approach is conformant to the https://OP-TED.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html[SEMIC Style Guide] and with https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/doc/ontology-architecture/ontology-architecture.pdf[eProcurement Ontology Architecture specification].

The UML transformation is performed using XSLT stylesheets under the assumption that the UML model conforms to the set of conventions outlined in the https://meaningfy-ws.github.io/model2owl-docs/public-review/uml/conceptual-model-conventions.html[EPO UML conventions specification]. This set of UML conventions is aligned with and extends the UML conventions specified in https://OP-TED.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html[SEMIC Style Guide].

The following capabilities are implemented:

* UML -> Compliance report (ideal for checking the model against the established conventions)
* UML -> Glossary (ideal for a quick overview of terminology defined)
* UML -> OWL 2 (lightweight ontology suitable as a core vocabulary)
* UML -> OWL 2 (heavyweight ontology with additional axioms suitable for reasoning purposes)
* UML -> SHACL (data shapes suitable for representing an application profile)

This documentation is evolving and aims at covering the important aspects that one might be interested in when using these tools, including:

* The architectural setup of the project and the ontology
* The conceptual model conventions that the UML model should adhere to, in order to enable the tools to generate the best possible results.
* The transformation rules applied in the process of conversion.
* The set of validation rules that realise the established conventions (and UML interpretations).

This work is developed in the context of https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology[eProcurement ontology project] financed by the Digital Europe Programme and led by the https://op.europa.eu/en/[Publications Office of the European Union].

The tools can be used on any other ontology that is built according to the provided https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/doc/ontology-architecture/ontology-architecture.pdf[modelling architecture] and xref:uml/conceptual-model-conventions.adoc[UML conceptual model conventions].
