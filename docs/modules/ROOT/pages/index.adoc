The *model2owl* https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl/[GitHub project] comprises a set of tools for transforming a UML (v2.5) model from its XMI (v2.5.1) serialisation into the formal ontology and associated SHACL data shapes. This transformation is performed using XSLT stylesheets under the assumption that the UML model conforms to the set of conventions outlined in this documentation. In addition, we provide a UML conventions checker that validates the conformity of the input XMI.

This documentation covers all the important aspects that one might be interested in when using these tools, including:

* The architectural setup of the project and the ontology
* The conceptual model conventions that the UML model should adhere to, in order to allow the tools to generate the best possible results.
* The transformation rules applied in the process of conversion
* ...

This work is developed in the context of https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology[eProcurement ontology project] financed by the Digital Europe Programme and led by the https://op.europa.eu/en/[Publications Office of the European Union].

The tools can be used on any other ontology that is built according to the xref:architecture/ontology-architecture.adoc[architectural design] and xref:uml/conceptual-model-conventions.adoc[conceptual model conventions] described in this documentation.
