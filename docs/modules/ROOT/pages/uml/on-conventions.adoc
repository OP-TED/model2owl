== UML Model Conventions

The current set of UML Model Conventions are meant to guide the semantic engineers and ontolgy editors on producing consistent, uniform and uniquely interpretable conceptual models. Also, it is meant to help the readers of the conceptual models to interpret the meaning and eliminate any ambiguities. Finally, the conventions are  fit for implementation.

This set of guidelines is aligned with the SEMIC style guide [xref:references.adoc#ref:semic-style-guide[semic-style-guide]] and constitutes an extension and further elaboration of it.
