 *Title:* Package naming

*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
Package names shall be short lowercase strings representing an acronym or a short name.
|===

*Description:*

Package names shall be short, lowercase, normalised strings representing an acronym or a short name. They may serve as proxies for the namespace prefixes and used to resolve the name of any comprised elements when the prefix is not provided. This however should not be used as a primary naming method, but rather for suggesting corrections in the element name.
