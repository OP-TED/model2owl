 *Title:* Primitive vs. composite datatypes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
Composite data types shall be represented as uml:Class elements. Primitive data types, if needed to be modelled, shall be represented as uml:DataType elements.
|===

*Description:*

This convention draws the distinction between primitive (or atomic) types (consisting of single literal value) and composite types (consisting of multiple attributes) [xref:references.adoc#ref:isaHandbook2015[isaHandbook2015]]. In fact, the composite datatypes must be defined as classes and handled as such. For example: AmountType, Identifier, Quantity and Measure are to be treated as classes even if conceptually they could be seen as composite data types.

 *Title:* XSD and RDF datatypes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
For primitive data types the already existing (standardized or commonly used) datatypes, in particular those from XSD and RDF, shall be reused.
|===

*Description:*

It is recommended to employ the primitive datatypes that are already defined in XSD [xref:references.adoc#ref:xsd1.1-spec[xsd1.1-spec]] and RDF [xref:references.adoc#ref:rdf11[rdf11]], which cover the standard and most common types. Thus, definitions of custom data types shall be avoided unless the model really needs them. Such cases are, however, rare.

The data types defined in the UML model (and custom ones) are resolved into their XSD equivalent using the correspondences from the xref:#tab:uml2xsd[] table below. Note that the family of string datatypes is mapped to _rdf:langString_. This means that the instance data should provide a language tag for the textual data indicating how it should be read. This enables multilingual data specification. Also, note that Date is mapped to `xsd:date` and DateTime is mapped to `xsd:dateTime`. However, the `xsd:date` is not included in the OWL2 interpretation and instead a strong preference is expressed for `xsd:dateTime`. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the OWL2 specification, although the `xsd:date` is a valid datatype in the RDF data and in SPARQL queries.

Note that from the family of string datatypes we recommend using the following ones (in this order of preference): `rdf:PlainLiteral`, `rdfs:Literal`, `xsd:string`, and `rdf:langString`. Often enabling multilingual data specification is a necessity.

 *Title:* OWL 2 datatypes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
Whenever possible, OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF datatypes shall be used.
|===

*Description:*

We strongly recommended the use of OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF standard datatypes, if possible. They might be useful also for indicating a specific datatype, which is impossible with the UML ones. For example, making a distinction between a general string (`xsd:string`) and a literal with a language tag (`rdf:langString`), or XML encoded ones such as `rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral`.

 *Title:* Proxy datatypes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
For already existing datatypes proxy uml:DataType elements should be defined.
|===

*Description:*

For the model consistency, it is recommended that the proxy data types be defined in the model for the XSDfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/XSD_Datatypes] and RDF data typesfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes] used in the model. The proxies must follow the standard namespace convention using the `rdf:` and `xsd:` prefixes.

*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
uml:DataType elements shall not connect to other elements. They can only be referred to.
|===

*Description:*

There should be no outgoing connector from a uml:DataType element. uml:DataType elements should only be referred to, most commonly, by being used as the type of a uml:Attribute element. Declarations of uml:DataType elements that are not referred to should be avoided in order to keep the model lean and clean.
