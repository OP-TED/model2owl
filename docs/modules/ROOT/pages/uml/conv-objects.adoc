== Conventions on uml:Object elements

The generic conventions that are defined for all UML elements in the xref:uml/conv-general.adoc[General conventions] section apply also for the uml:Object element. This section provides a few additional conventions in addition to those.

[[rule:objects-attributes]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Objects with no Attributes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
uml:Object elements shall have no attributes specified.
|===

*Description:*

Objects in the UML model should be "empty", i.e. have no additional values/attributes specified.

They often would serve as a "proxy" for an individual, or SKOS concept, defined outside the current model.


[[rule:objects-relations]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Relations of Objects

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier* -

|*Statement:*
uml:Object element shall have no outgoing connectors, except uml:Realization connector(s) to some Class or Enumeration.
|===

*Description:*

Each Object should instantiate a Class or an Enumeration. Therefore, there shall be at least one uml:Realization relationship between the Object and a Class or Enumeration.

Except these realisation connectors, an Object should not connect to any other elements. An Object stands for a specific instance of a class and/or an element of a controlled list, and can only be referred to.
