= Introduction

// [[sec:context]]
// == Context
This document defines the style guide to be applied to the SEMIC's semantic data specifications, notably to the eGovernment
Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. It provides rules on naming conventions, syntax, artefact management and organisation.
It is meant to be complemented with technical artefacts and implementations that enable automatic conformance checking and
transformation of conceptual models into formal semantic representations.

The content of these guides is part of the action to promote semantic interoperability amongst the EU Member States,
with the objective of fostering the use of standards by, for example, offering guidelines and expert advice on semantic interoperability
for public administrations.

[[sec:target-audience]]
== Target audience
This style guide is intended primarily for semantic engineers, data architects and knowledge modelling specialists who are acting as editors or reusers of Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles.

This style guide may constitute a good source of information and explanations for the European Commission's officers, collaborating consultants, and stakeholders involved in inter-institutional standardisation.

[[sec:scope]]
== Scope
The main purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance and decision-making support for the creators, maintainers and publishers of the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. In the context of European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [xref:references.adoc#ref:eif[eif]] this style guide primarily addresses the _Semantic Interoperability_ layer.
The main part of this document is organised as a series of self-contained rules and guidelines.

In the scope of this document are included:

* a terminological clarification for the significant SEMIC terms (including "reuse", "ontology", "Core Vocabulary", etc.);
* an architecture overview, which interconnects various aspects and data specification types and how they are derived from a single
conceptual model;
* the concept of "reuse" in great detail and pinpoints exactly what is permitted and what is not permitted in the SEMIC context;
* recommendations on organising the conceptual model, the semantic artefacts, and the data shapes;
* some recommendations on the specification development methodology and some publication conventions.

It is considered out of the scope of this document to provide:

* a complete and specific modelling methodology,
* a procedure for maintenance and publication,
* governance (roles, processes, responsibilities, etc.), lifecycle and release management methodology (including the initiation and
change requests),
* any specific implementation instructions,
* indications as to what set of tools shall be adopted,
* specifications related to data serialisation, formats or any syntax mapping methods (including syntax binding instructions to for
example XSD/XML; or JSON-LD contexts),
* usage instructions for the end users.

This style guide is recommended to be used in combination with complementary documents, among which we consider relevant, but not
limited to, the following ones:

* the  user manual of a transformation tool from UML into other representations explaining what transformation rules are supported
(i.e. implemented by the tool),
* the documentation (manuals, handbooks, specifications) of the reused data specifications,
* the governance and methodology documentation of the organisation developing the new semantic data specification,
the adopted URI policy documentation, which can be inter-institutional policy or organisation specific one
[xref:references.adoc#ref:10rules-puri[10rules-puri]].

[[sec:how-to-read]]
== How to read this document
This document is organised in two parts. The first part provides a brief context description and scope and offers an architectural
overview. It introduces important terminological clarifications, the benefits of adopting the separation of concerns principle,
and explanations of how it is played out in the SEMIC context.

The second part of the document provides a series of guidelines, conventions and assumption specifications. These guidelines are
organised according to the aspects they cover. A guideline is a stand-alone description containing an indicative statement and a
detailed description providing the rationale, benefits and limitations, implications and practical requirements, and eventually examples.

Users who may choose to bypass introductory details may decide to proceed with reading the
xref:gc-general-conventions.adoc[general guidelines] and the ones on the xref:gc-conceptual-model-conventions.adoc[conceptual model] first.
