	\subsection{Charset}
	\label{sec:charset}
	
	The ontology shall be encoded in at least RDF \cite{rdf11} and XML\cite{xml1-spec} and shall conform to both format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set, or an underscore (\_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character \cite{d3.1-2015}. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document \cite{xml1-spec}.
	
	It is required that the names use words beginning with an upper or lower case letter (A--Z, a--z) or an underscore (\_) for all terms in the model. Digits (0--9) are allowed in the subsequent character positions.
