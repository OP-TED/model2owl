        <!-- Description for the CORE module -->
        <desc>This module provides the definitions for the core eProcurement ontology.        
            Procurement data has been identified as data with a
            high-reuse potential. Given the increasing importance of data standards for
            eProcurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector, the industry and
            academia have been kick-started in recent years. Some have grown organically, while
            others are the result of standardisation work. The vocabularies and the semantics that
            they are introducing, the phases of public procurement that they are covering, and the
            technologies that they are using all differ. These differences hamper data
            interoperability and thus its reuse by them or by the wider public. This creates the
            need for a common data standard for publishing procurement data, hence allowing data
            from different sources to be easily accessed and linked, and consequently
            reused.
